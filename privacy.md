Kai Actions Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 2025

Kai Actions are designed to respect privacy, consent, and truth. This policy explains what data is used, how it’s handled, and what control you have.

1. What Kai Actions Collect

Kai Actions do not collect personal data beyond what is necessary to perform the requested action.
This may include:

Inputs you provide directly in chat (e.g., text or uploaded files).

Temporary operational data required to complete a task (e.g., API requests or tool outputs).

No biometric, location, or background data is gathered.

2. How Data Is Used

All data is used solely to execute the specific Kai Action requested by the user.
Kai does not:

Sell or share data with third parties.

Use data for marketing, analytics, or training outside the scope of the active session.

3. Data Storage and Retention

By default, data from Kai Actions is processed ephemerally — meaning it is not stored once the task is complete.
If an action or service provider must retain temporary data (e.g., for debugging or transaction logs), it follows that provider’s standard retention and deletion policies.

4. User Control and Consent

You are always in control:

You can delete all reflections or remembered content at any time using in-chat commands.

You may request that no data be remembered beyond your active session.

Using a Kai Action implies consent only for that specific task.

5. External Services

If a Kai Action integrates with an external API or service (for example, GitHub, Notion, or Google Drive), the privacy practices of those providers also apply. Users are encouraged to review the policies of any connected service.

6. Security

Data transmitted through Kai Actions uses secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
No additional data is stored or exposed beyond what is necessary for the task.
